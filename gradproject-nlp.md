## Project Description: Natural Language Processing

A common task in real-life data analysis involves working with text data. In this project, we will work with a dataset consisting of natural language questions asked by humans and answers provided by chatbots.

### Project Goals
{:.no_toc}

- Gain practical experience with text data by applying techniques like embedding generation, tokenization, and topic modeling.
- Analyze a real-world dataset of chatbot conversations, including human questions, responses, and user votes.
- Formulate specific, data-driven questions and use the dataset to answer these questions with evidence.

### Dataset Description
{:.no_toc}

The source dataset link is [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lmsys/chatbot_arena_conversations){:target="_blank"}. The author describes the dataset as follows:

> This dataset contains 33K cleaned conversations with pairwise human preferences. It is collected from 13K unique IP addresses on the Chatbot Arena from April to June 2023. Each sample includes a question ID, two model names, their full conversation text in OpenAI API JSON format, the user vote, the anonymized user ID, the detected language tag, the OpenAI moderation API tag, the additional toxic tag, and the timestamp.

#### Main Dataset

`chatbot-arena-conversations.jsonl.gz`: The primary dataset with over 25,000 cleaned chatbot conversations. It includes the question, responses from two chatbot models, user votes, and anonymized user information. It has gone through preprocessing to remove non-English conversations, multiple rounds of conversations, and toxic or harmful content.

#### Auxiliary Datasets

You are given the following two auxiliary datasets that you can use to help with your analysis:

**Embeddings**

  - `chatbot-arena-prompts-embeddings.npy`: Precomputed 256-dimensional embeddings for the human questions, useful for modeling and analysis.
  - `chatbot-arena-model_a_response-embeddings.npy`: Precomputed 256-dimensional embeddings for the model responses, useful for modeling and analysis.
  - `chatbot-arena-model_b_response-embeddings.npy`: Precomputed 256-dimensional embeddings for the model responses, useful for modeling and analysis.

**Topic Modeling and Hardness Score Data**

  - `chatbot-arena-gpt3-scores.jsonl.gz`: GPT-3.5-generated labels, including topic models and hardness scores for each question, providing additional features for analysis.
The detailed descriptions of each dataset can be found in the notebook below.


## Action Items

You are required to perform **(1) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **(2) Modeling (Task A and Task B)** for this project.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

During EDA, you have to analyze the dataset to uncover patterns and insights. Formulate questions such as:

- What is the win rate of different models?
- What topics are most common?
- Do different judges have different preferences?
- What factors make a question hard?

You can get started with the following starter notebook for EDA: [`nlp-eda-starter.ipynb`](https://data100.datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FDS-100%2Ffa24-student&urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2Ffa24-student%2Fgrad-proj%2Fnlp-chatbot-analysis%2Fnlp-eda-starter.ipynb&branch=main).

See below in the description for [Milestone 2](#milestone-2-eda) for detailed instructions for the report.

### Project Tasks

Now, we aim to better understand the different chatbot models! Please complete both Task A and B. We have included example questions to consider, but you are expected to come up with your own questions to answer.

For both tasks, you will be working with the training set provided. But you are also expected to perform prediction on a test set (`./test-set/arena-test-set-prompt-and-responses.jsonl.gz`). This data contains fields `question_id`, `prompt`, `model_a`, `model_b`, `model_a_response`, and `model_b_response`. **You are expected to predict the winner and the hardness score for tasks A and B respectively.** Feel free to also use existing or new feature-transformed data (e.g. embeddings etc.) to improve predictions. (For example, we have already provided the embedding data for you which is an example of feature-transformed data in the same directory if you end up needing this feature).

**You should submit your final prediction as a `csv` file with three columns `question_id`, `winner`, `hardness_score`. The `winner` column should be one of the four values: `model_a`, `model_b`, `tie`, or `tie (bothbad)`. The `hardness_score` should be an integer from 1 to 10.**


#### *Task A: Modeling the Winning Model*
{:.no_toc}
Predict which chatbot model will win the user vote based on the prompt and model responses.

Steps you can take:
1. Start by analyzing features such as the length, text characteristics, and embeddings of the prompt.
2. Compare the outputs of the two chatbot models to find patterns.
3. Use a classification model (e.g., logistic regression) to predict the winner given `prompt`, `model_a`, `model_b`, `model_a_response`, and `model_b_response`.
4. Use appropriate metrics to evaluate the performance of your model.

One hint would be to utilize topic modeling data by first clustering prompts given their embeddings, then for each cluster, train a model to predict the winner. Also, feel free to use the hardness score to help with the prediction.

#### *Task B: Hardness Prediction*
{:.no_toc}
Predict the difficulty of a question, ranging from 1 to 10, using the available features. For example, if a prompt’s score is 1, we expect the weak model to be able to answer the question. If the score is 10, we expect the question to be hard, maybe only GPT4 can answer it.

Steps you can take:
5. Start by examining the question embeddings and topic modeling data. Look for patterns that might help predict question difficulty.
6. Use linear regression to predict the hardness score. Incorporate relevant features from the data to improve your predictions.
7. Ensure that your model predicts integer values between 1 and 10.
8. Use appropriate metrics to evaluate the performance of your model.

One challenging aspect here is that the output score should be an integer value, while linear regression is used for continuous data.

Additionally, here are some example questions about the project that you are welcome to explore.
> Modeling: Perform some modeling tasks given our ground truth labels. Can you train a logistic regression model to predict the winner-given embeddings? How about a K-means clustering model to cluster the questions? Can you use linear regression to predict the hardness score? We expect you to demonstrate how the well model works and how to evaluate them. You should justify the choice of model and the evaluation metrics. You should also discuss the limitations of the model and how to improve them.

> Analysis: By leveraging the question embeddings, can we find similar questions? How repeated are the questions in the dataset? Can you reproduce the Elo score rating for the chatbots and come up with a better ranking? How can we make sense of the data overall?

Resources
- [Joey’s EDA and Elo rating modeling](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1KdwokPjirkTmpO_P1WByFNFiqxWQquwH){:target="_blank"} is a great resource to get started with the EDA. Note that (1) the plot is made with Plotly, we recommend you to reproduce the plot with Matplotlib or Seaborn, and (2) the Elo rating is a good modeling task to reproduce but we expect you to do more than just that (for example, demonstrate how Elo rating works and how to calculate it in your report).

- [An intuitive introduction to text embeddings](https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/11/09/an-intuitive-introduction-to-text-embeddings/){:target="_blank"} is a good resource to understand what is text embeddings and how to use them.

- [Elo rating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) and [Bradley-Terry model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley%E2%80%93Terry_model){:target="_blank"} are essential to model a ranking among the pairwise comparison.
- [Huggingface pipeline](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/main_classes/pipelines){:target="_blank"} has many implementations of common NLP tasks for you to use, including sentiment analysis, summarization, text classification, etc.

- [spaCy](https://spacy.io/usage/spacy-101){:target="_blank"} is a wonderful library containing classifical NLP tasks like tokenization, lemmatization, etc.

The internal peer review [Gradescope assignment](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/827978/assignments/5159827){:target="_blank"} for this milestone is due by **11:59 pm on November 22**.

### Milestone 5: Project Report First Draft (18%) - December 2, 2024

The first draft of your final report, please see below for more information on what you should aim to submit. You do not need to submit the video and test set performance components for milestone 5, but you are expected to submit a comprehensive written report that summarizes your analysis.

Please refer to the section on the [Final Project Report](#final-project-report) for more information on how your first draft will roughly be graded. Your first draft will be graded more leniently than your final submission, but we’re still looking for largely the same elements. You do not need to submit the video and test set performance components for milestone 5, but you are expected to submit a comprehensive written report that summarizes your analysis.

Submit to the [first draft project report assignment](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/827978/assignments/5045727/) on Gradescope by **11:59pm on December 2**.

### Milestone 6: External Peer Review (7.5%) - December 6, 2024

Each group will peer review a project from another group; each group will be graded together based on the feedback they provide in their review. Each review should include the following components:

1. (1.5%) A summary of the report. The summary should address at least the following:
- What is the conclusion drawn from the EDA and modeling results?
- What data modeling/inference techniques do the group primarily use to gain insights into their research question? Why are these techniques suitable for the task?
- What are the next steps a researcher can take if they want to improve their model further based on the work in the project?

2. (6%, 1% per component) An evaluation of the report based on the Data Science Lifecycle. The review should include at least **one strong point and one suggestion for improvement** for each of the following components in the project:
- Data collection and sampling
- Data cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (data wrangling, visualization, etc.)
- Data modeling (feature engineering, selection of the model, and evaluation of the model's performance, etc.)
- Inference (do the results from the model sufficiently support the conclusion within the report?)
- Discussion (does the report effectively discuss the limitations of the methods used and the implications of the results?)

The external peer review is also a great chance to learn from other people's work and reflect on your own work. Submit one combined review to the [external peer review assignment](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/827978/assignments/5392834){:target="_blank"} on Gradescope by **11:59pm on December 6**. Remember to add your group members on your submission.

### [Component 2] Project Write-Up (20%)

This is a single PDF that summarizes your workflow and what you have learned. It should be structured as a research paper and include a title, list of authors, abstract, introduction, description of data, methodology, summary of results, discussion, conclusion, and references. Make sure to number figures and tables, include informative captions, and ensure you include the provenance of the figures in the main narrative. We encourage you to render the PDF using LaTeX, but we will not be able to provide assistance with LaTeX-related issues.

Specifically, you should ensure you address the following in the narrative:

* Introduction: ensure you include a brief survey of related work on the topic(s) of your analysis. Be sure to reference current approaches/research in the context of your project, as well as how your project differs from or complements existing research. You must cite all the references you discuss in this section.
* Description of data: ensure you outline the summary of the data and how the data was prepared for the modeling phase (summarizing your EDA work). If applicable, descriptions of additional datasets that you gathered to support your analysis may also be included.
* Methodology: carefully describe the methods/models you use and why they are appropriate for answering your research questions. You must include a detailed description of how modeling is done in your project, including inference or prediction methods used, feature engineering and regularization if applicable, and cross-validation or test data as appropriate for model selection and evaluation. You may also include interesting findings involving your datasets.
* Summary of results: analyze your findings in relation to your research question(s). Include/reference visualizations and specific results. Discuss any interesting findings from your analysis. You are encouraged to compare the results using different inference or prediction methods (e.g. linear regression, logistic regression, or classification and regression trees). Can you explain why some methods performed better than others?
* Discussion: evaluate your approach and discuss any limitations of the methods you used. Also, briefly describe any surprising discoveries and whether there are any interesting extensions to your analysis.

The narrative PDF should include figures sparingly to support specific claims. It can include a few runnable code components, but it should not have large amounts of code. The length of the report should be 8 ± 2 pages when it is printed as a PDF, excluding figures and code.

Tip: if you need to write a large amount of LaTeX on markdown, you may want to use the `%%latex` cell magic. However, we also encourage you to explore [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com){:target="_blank"} for easily writing clean LaTeX documents.
