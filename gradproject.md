# Graduate Project
{:.no_toc}

* TOC
{:toc}

## Introduction

The graduate project is **offered only to students enrolled in Data C200, CS C200A, or Data 200S**. Other students are welcome to explore the questions and datasets in the project for personal learning, but their work will not be graded or counted towards their final grades.

The purpose of the project is to give students experience in both open-ended data science analysis and research in general.

### Teamwork

**You must work in groups of two or three students.** In order to give everyone experience in collaborating on a data science project, individual projects are not allowed. Everyone in the same group will receive the same grade (except for exceptional circumstances).

For each milestone listed above, detailed expectations can be found in the "Milestone" section under each of the project topics (Computer Vision or Natural Language Processing) which is explained above. Please refer to these sections for specific requirements and guidelines related to your chosen project topic.

### Late Policy
- **No Extensions for Milestones**: Must be submitted on time; no extensions are permitted. Milestones cannot be submitted late as they are crucial for the peer review process.
- **Final Report and Presentation Video**: Late submissions incur a 10% daily penalty, up to a maximum of two days. Submissions are rounded to the nearest day (e.g., 2 minutes late counts as 1 day late).

## Accessing Datasets

All of the provided datasets can be found in the Datahub directory `shared/course/data100-shared-readwrite/fa24_grad_project_data`. You can access the data directly from Datahub. If you wish to work on the project locally, you can also download the files containing the datasets for each topic by right-clicking on the file in JupyterLab and select "Copy Download Link". If you choose to train more complex models, DataHub might not have enough hardware resources or memory, in which case you can use [Google Colab](https://colab.google/){:target="_blank"} or your local machine. If you would like to use Google Colab, feel free to check out this [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48376580/how-to-read-data-in-google-colab-from-my-google-drive){:target="_blank"} to get started.
